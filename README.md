# oharvester

**Goal**: A repository with a library of functions, scripts, and tutorials for harvesting oceanographic data.

* Each tool works basically like this:
  ```
  toolX(time range, spatial range, data source)
    {
      gets [data] from specified source
      returns [data]
      (or possibly saves [data] to a file)
    }
    ```
